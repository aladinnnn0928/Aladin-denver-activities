            01.Design with visual hierarchy in mind
            Keep your homepage minimalist and free of clutter
            your websites home pages should communicate your core message instaneously.
            after all we rarely read word on a website. instead, we quickly scan the page, 
            picking out keywords, sentences and images. With these known behaviors in mind, 
            it's better to appeal to emotioms rather than word count.
